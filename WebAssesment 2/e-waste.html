        <h3></h3>
        <p>If you have unwanted electronics consider selling them or donating them instead of throwing them away. This
            helps keep hazardous materials out of landfils, and maybe even net you a little bit of money :)</p>
        <h3></h3>
        <p>If your electronics are broken, then instead of throwing them in the landfill take them to a resource
            recovery centre.
            E-waste can contain precious resources that can be easily recycles and used for other things.
