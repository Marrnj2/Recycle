        <h2>How to recycle</h2>
        <p>It is important when recycleing to sort trash into the appropriat bins. By properly sorting and prepareing
            your recycleing you ensure that your councils waste management will actually pick up your trash, and not
            leave it uncollected with a mean looking red tag attached.
        </p>
        <h3>Recycling Bins</h3>
        <p>Otago uses two diifernt bins for recycleing. These bins are used to recycle differnt kinds of waste. These
            bins are collected
            on alternating weeks, information regarding bin rotation can be found on your local councils website.
        </p>
        <h3>What goes in these bins?</h3>
        <h4>Blue Bins</h4>
        <p>The blue bins are for all glass recycleing. This includes any jars or in if 
        </p>
        <h4>What not to put in blue bins</h4>
        <p>Not every peice of glass is able to be recycled in this little blue bin. Fragile glass such as cups cannot be
            recycled in blue bins as they would break during the collection proccess. This also means any broken glass
            cannot be recycled. Other enelgeble candidates are mirrors or sheet glass.</p>

        <h3>Preparing recycleables</h3>
        <h4>Rinse your Bottles and Jars!</h4>
        <p>The friendly folk at the recycleing plant dont want to have to deal with you mouldy pasta jars. Do them a
            favor and rinse them out first. Rinse out any remaining contents from any jars or plastics you have.</p>
        <h4>Aluminium Cans and Tins</h4>
        <p>The lids of these cans cannot be recycled so they should be dicarded. It is also easier to recycle these cans
            if they are not crushed or bent.
