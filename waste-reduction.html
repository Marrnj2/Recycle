        <h2>Reduceing your impact on the enviroment</h2>
        <h3>Reuse</h3>
        <h4>Op shops</h4>
        <p>Donating to op shops is a great to get rid of items you dont want without harming the enviroment. So many
            things can be donated to op shops like
            clothes, crokary, glass ware and so many others. Another great thing about op shops is you can always find
            great things while shopping here you cant find any where else. </p>
        <h4>Rummage Day</h4>
        <p>Some landfills like the Green Island Landfill in Dunedin allow people to drop off items in good condition
            free of charge . They
            then let others come in an "Rummage" through the items. Just like OP shopping you can find many different
            things here ranging from books a beds
        </p>
        <h3>Transport</h3>
        <p>Instead of driving to work conisder other options. Carpooling is a greatway to reduce the number of cars on
            the road and gas being consumed.
            Or why not try bikeing to get around, save the enviroment and your body!
        </p>
        <h3>Buy Localy</h3>
        <p>Farmers markets are a great way to reduce your impact the enviroment. Small farms have less of an impact on
            the enviroment. Locally produced food does not have to travel as far as imported produce saving emmisons
            made by transporting the goods</p>
